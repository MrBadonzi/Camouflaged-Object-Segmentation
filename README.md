# Camouflaged-Object-Segmentation
This is a implementation of the paper *Camouflaged Object Segmentation with Distraction Mining* (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Mei_Camouflaged_Object_Segmentation_With_Distraction_Mining_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf)
This project was developed for the exam of Vision and Perseption of Sapienza University.

# Description
Camouflaged object segmentation is a challenging task in computer vision, since the camouflage strategy works by deceiving
the visual perception system of the observer. By leveraging a solution that exists in nature, this paper improves segmentation accuracy by emulatinng the natural predation process. 
This bio-inspired framework is called Positioning and Focus Network (PFNet).  

# Requirements
This project requires the original dataset from the referenced paper, which can be downloaded via the link provided in the paper (https://mhaiyang.github.io/CVPR2021_PFNet/index). Once downloaded, the dataset should be uploaded to a Google Drive folder, and this folder must be linked to the Colab notebook.
